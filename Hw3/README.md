## To use

### You need to find different template since I quite illigal to direct use from me atleast visit `HTML5UP` website

#### Find tutorial on how to run flask app on flask Doc

#### this directory is use `weirgzung` and `wtform` to perform upload you might need to read the doc if u want to use

#### I use chatGPT to generate a jsonl pipeline for education title extracting and partial copied from Tonson

----------------

## If you dont want to use a doc

then `pip install -r requirement.txt`
then on bash -> $ `export FLASK_APP = main`
then $`flask run`
### But u still need to download your own template

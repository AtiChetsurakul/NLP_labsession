| Topic        | A Fast and Accurate Dependency Parser using Neural Networks |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Main point            | with small number of dense features in the model, it can perform really fast with better performance   |
| Problem sloved        | Dependency Parsing  |
| Important of problem  | speed of parsing is still slow |
| Prev Work             | feature-based discrim- inative dependency parsers (Ku ̈bler et al., 2009) <br>a Temporal Restricted Boltzman Machine (2013)|
| Method                | neural network with input of word, pos and arc label, and output from softmax |
| Justification         | Accuracy and parsing speed on PTB outperform other method<br> While on CTB also outperform the other method |
<!-- | Limitation   |  only rely on dense features (POS tags and arc labels(dependency))| -->
